    <center><h1>Photosynthesis</h1></center>
    <p><b>Photosynthesis</b> is a biological process used by many cellular organisms to convert <u>light energy</u> into <em>chemical energy</em>, which is stored in organic compounds that can later be metabolized through cellular respiration to fuel the organism's activities. </p>

    <p>The term usually refers to oxygenic photosynthesis, where <strong>oxygen</strong> is produced as a byproduct, and some of the chemical energy produced is stored in carbohydrate molecules such as sugars, starch and cellulose, which are synthesized from endergonic reaction of carbon dioxide with water. Most plants, algae and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the biological energy necessary for complex life on Earth.</p>

    <h2>Carbon concentrating mechanisms</h2>
    <p>In hot and dry conditions, plants close their stomata to prevent water loss. Under these conditions, CO2 will decrease and oxygen gas, produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis, will increase, causing an increase of photorespiration by the oxygenase activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and decrease in carbon fixation.</p>
